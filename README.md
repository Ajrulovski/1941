First commit Vibe-coded with Gemini Pro.
Went through a set of iterations in a matter of 3h
The prompts:

Here is the list of prompts you used during this session, in chronological order:
 * Create a "1941 battle of midway" game clone with threejs
 * Add controls for mobile phone
 * Make it so the game is happening above a real life satelite imagery moving as the plane is flying
 * Make the game 2D like the original game
 * Ok, now lets make the following changes:
   * The terrain seems to be moving in the wrong direction, I have a feeling as if my plane is riding backwards
   * Add an energy bar for me so that the game has some kind of a goal - that is that I need to take care not to be hit by the enemies
   * Add shooting dynamics from the enemy planes and other vehicles. They should be able to shoot at me
   * Add power up items to be picked up during flight so that I can obtain weapons upgrades
   * When shooting by tapping on the right side of the screen, the screen is flashing red. Remove that effect.
 * The game is moving too fast and the enemies are a lot and are all shooting. Make it go a bit slower and make it a bit easier. Also add various forms of backround such as different colors of terrain for land, grass, trees, water etc
 * Next:
   * Add a possibility to pause the game
   * Add an appereance of the game boss once I reach a 3000 points mark
   * Once the boss is defeated initiate a level 2 where the level 2 will happen above a different terrain (so not archipelago but something geographically and topologically different)
   * The level 2 should be 20% harder than level 1.
   * At the beggining of each level flash a message e.g. "Level 1: engage!"
 * Something is wrong here. When I open the html file I am seeing a black screen with only the health bar at the top and the P button
 * Ok so your last two attempts failed. Lets try this again: use the attached version of the game and add a final boss appereance once the 3000 points mark is reached
 * Add weapon upgrade power-up packages, seems like those are gone. Also make the enemies shoot a bit less. Plus add a joystick like control in the lower left corner for plane control instead of the swiping on the left half of the screen
 * Now I can't hit any of the planes no matter how much I shoot and wherenthe plane is positioned
 * Add a arcade style high score registering feature so that once the game is over you can record your score
